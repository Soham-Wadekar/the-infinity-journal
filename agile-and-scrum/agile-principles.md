## Core Concepts

- **Agile Manifesto** – The foundational values and principles guiding Agile.  
- **Scrum** – A lightweight Agile framework with defined roles, ceremonies, and artifacts.  
- **Kanban** – Agile method focused on visualizing work and limiting WIP (Work In Progress).  
- **Incremental Delivery** – Delivering software in small, usable chunks.  
- **Iteration / Sprint** – A short, fixed timebox (1–4 weeks) in which work is completed.  

---

## Roles

- **Product Owner (PO)** – Prioritizes work, owns the product backlog, represents customer needs.  
- **Scrum Master** – Facilitates the process, removes blockers, ensures Scrum is followed.  
- **Development Team** – Cross-functional group that delivers the increment.  
- **Stakeholders** – Anyone invested in the product outcome (customers, management, users).  

---

## Ceremonies

- **Sprint Planning** – Decide what to build in the upcoming Sprint.  
- **Daily Scrum (Standup)** – 15-min daily sync: yesterday, today, blockers.  
- **Sprint Review** – Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders.  
- **Sprint Retrospective** – Reflect and improve the process for the next Sprint.

## Artifacts

- **Product Backlog** – Ordered list of everything to build.  
- **Sprint Backlog** – Subset of backlog items selected for the Sprint.  
- **Increment** – The usable product output from a Sprint.  
- **Definition of Done (DoD)** – Shared agreement on what “done” means.  
- **User Story** – A feature expressed in customer terms:  
  _“As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].”_  
- **Epic** – A large story that can be broken into smaller user stories.  

---

## Metrics

- **Velocity** – Average story points completed per Sprint.  
- **Burndown Chart** – Work remaining vs. time in a Sprint.  
- **Burnup Chart** – Work completed vs. total scope.  
- **Cycle Time** – Time taken to complete a single item.  
- **Lead Time** – Time taken from request to delivery.

💡 Agile = the philosophy. Scrum & Kanban = frameworks that implement it.
