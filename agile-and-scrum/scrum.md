## Overview

- Iterative, incremental approach.  
- Timeboxed work periods called **Sprints** (usually 2 weeks).  
- Empirical process control: transparency, inspection, adaptation.  
- Lightweight but not incomplete ‚Äî Scrum must be followed as defined.

## Scrum Roles

- **Product Owner (PO)** ‚Äì Owns the **Product Backlog**, maximizes product value.  
- **Scrum Master** ‚Äì Facilitator, servant-leader, removes impediments, coaches the team.  
- **Development Team** ‚Äì Cross-functional team members who actually build the product.

## Scrum Artifacts

- **Product Backlog** ‚Äì Ordered list of everything desired in the product.  
- **Sprint Backlog** ‚Äì Selected backlog items for the Sprint + plan to deliver them.  
- **Increment** ‚Äì Potentially shippable product at the end of a Sprint.  
- **Definition of Done (DoD)** ‚Äì Agreement on what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means (quality criteria).

## Scrum Events

1. **Sprint** (the heartbeat of Scrum, usually 2 weeks).  
2. **Sprint Planning** ‚Äì What can we deliver? How will we deliver it?  
3. **Daily Scrum (Standup)** ‚Äì 15-min sync: progress & impediments.  
4. **Sprint Review** ‚Äì Present Increment to stakeholders, gather feedback.  
5. **Sprint Retrospective** ‚Äì Inspect & adapt the team‚Äôs process.

## Scrum Flow

1. Product Owner manages the **Product Backlog**.  
2. During **Sprint Planning**, items are chosen to form the **Sprint Backlog**.  
3. Team executes the work in the **Sprint**, holding **Daily Scrums**.  
4. At the end, the **Increment** is reviewed in a **Sprint Review**.  
5. The team reflects in a **Sprint Retrospective** and improves.

## Best Practices

- Keep Sprints consistent in length.  
- Focus on delivering **value**, not just finishing tasks.  
- Empower teams to self-organize.  
- Maintain a clear and transparent backlog.  
- Continuously refine backlog items (Backlog Grooming / Refinement).

üí° Scrum = framework. Agile = philosophy.  
Scrum follows Agile principles but adds **structure**.
