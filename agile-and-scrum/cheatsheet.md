This is something which is used daily in corporate but seems alien to freshers. So, this cheat sheet is a quick reference for the Agile mindset, Scrum framework, and common ceremonies. Hope it helps!

## 🌱 Agile Basics

- **Agile Manifesto** values:
  1. Individuals & interactions > Processes & tools  
  2. Working software > Comprehensive documentation  
  3. Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation  
  4. Responding to change > Following a plan  

- Agile is a **mindset**, not a methodology.  
- Focus on **iterative delivery** and **continuous improvement**.

## 🏉 Scrum Framework

- **Sprint** = 1–4 weeks, fixed length (usually 2 weeks).  
- **Roles**:  
  - Product Owner (PO) → owns backlog, maximizes value  
  - Scrum Master → facilitator, coach, removes blockers  
  - Dev Team → cross-functional, builds product  

- **Artifacts**:  
  - Product Backlog → list of desired work  
  - Sprint Backlog → items selected for current Sprint  
  - Increment → working product output  
  - Definition of Done (DoD) → shared quality criteria  

- **Events (Ceremonies)**:  
  1. **Sprint Planning** – decide what to deliver & how  
  2. **Daily Scrum (Standup)** – 15 min sync  
  3. **Sprint Review** – demo Increment, get feedback  
  4. **Sprint Retrospective** – inspect & improve process

## 🔑 Scrum Principles
