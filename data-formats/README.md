# 🗂️ Data Formats

Welcome to the **Data Formats** section of **The Infinity Journal** — a space for exploring the languages and syntaxes used to structure, store, and exchange data across systems.

Here you'll find everything I learn (and continue to learn) about data formats like XML, YAML, JSON, TOML, and more.

## ✨ Why Data Formats?

Data formats are the **universal translators** of the digital world.  
They allow different systems, languages, and platforms to **understand each other** by agreeing on a common structure.

From APIs and configuration files to document storage and inter-service communication, choosing the right format impacts **readability, interoperability, and performance**.

- Validation and tooling
- Real-world examples

Where possible, comparisons and conversions between formats are included.
