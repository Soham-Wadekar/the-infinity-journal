# ♾️ The Infinity Journal

> A lifelong archive of everything I learn — one byte at a time

This journal is a lifelong archive of everything I uncover, question, and understand in the boundless realm of the digital world.
I intend to update it regularly, capturing what I learn as I go, refining it, and returning to it as my understanding deepens.

My ambition is simple: to explore the entirety of the digital universe as I can — until I either master it… or lose my mind trying.

> Right now, I know just enough to realize how much I don’t. This journal will be updated in bits and bursts, as I explore and try to make sense of it all.
