# 📦 Package Managers

Package managers are tools that help install, update, configure, and remove software on Linux systems.  
They handle dependencies automatically and ensure that the right versions of packages are installed from trusted repositories.

This section explores the different package managers used across Linux distributions, their commands, workflows, and unique features.

## ✨ Why Package Managers?

Without package managers, installing software would mean manually downloading, compiling, and configuring source code.  
Package managers simplify this process by providing a **standardized, automated way** to manage software, saving time and reducing errors.
