# 🐧 Linux

Welcome to the Linux section of **The Infinity Journal** — a space dedicated to exploring the foundations of Linux systems, distributions, and the tools that power them.  

Here you'll find everything I've learned (and continue to learn) about Linux — from core commands and system internals to distro-specific notes and package management.

## ✨ Why Linux?

Linux is the backbone of the digital world.  
From servers to supercomputers, Android devices to embedded systems — Linux powers it all.  

Learning Linux is not just about commands; it’s about mastering a way of thinking where **control, customization, and clarity** matter most.

## 🛠️ How to Use

Each `.md` file covers a specific topic or tool.  

- `distros/` contains notes on individual Linux distributions.  
- `package-managers/` contains deep dives into package management tools.  

Follow them in order if you’re building a foundational understanding, or jump into the distro or tool you’re currently using.
